# Topological Search 

> see [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/solution/)

> Topological Search can be done in one of two ways:
> 1. Recursive DFS searsch, while maintaining coloring vertex dictionary, and stack, which is added after all children have been populated. The returned stack is in reversed order
> 2. In degree adj_list and queue, which contains all nodes with zero in degree. then reducing all in-degree of their neighbours iterativly. Cycle check can be validated if the length of topological_sorted_order is as the amount of vertices in the graph.
