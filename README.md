# Technical-Interviews

Welcome to the algorithms repository for technical interviews! This repository is designed to help you prepare for technical interviews.
It contains a variety of algorithms, that are commonly tested in technical interviews (and which are covered in LeetCode).

## How to Use
Each algorithm is located in its own file, along with a brief description of what the algorithm does and its time and space complexity. 
You can browse the files in this repository to learn more about each algorithm and try out the code for yourself.

## Contributing
We encourage you to contribute to this repository by submitting pull requests with additional algorithms, data structures, or improvements to existing code.
To contribute, simply fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Please ensure that any algorithms you add are well-documented and include explanations of how they work and (perhaps) time and space complexity.
